# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. It is commonly used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

## Example
- The factorial calculation demonstrates recursion in action. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The recursive definition of factorial is:

factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1) for n > 0
factorial(0) = 1

## Commentary:
Recursion provides a concise and elegant way to solve certain problems, as seen in the factorial calculation.
However, it's important to handle base cases correctly to avoid infinite recursion.
In the provided Python example, the recursive factorial function showcases how a problem can be decomposed into simpler versions of itself until reaching a base case.

## Advantages of Recursion
Concise Code: Recursive solutions can often be more concise and elegant than iterative solutions for certain problems.
Simplifies Complexity: Recursion can simplify the implementation of complex algorithms by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

## Disadvantages of Recursion
Stack Overflow: Recursion can lead to stack overflow errors, especially for large inputs or when the recursion depth is too high.
Requires Understanding: Writing recursive functions requires a good understanding of base cases and termination conditions. Failing to define these correctly can result in infinite recursion.
