# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. It is commonly used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

## Example
- The factorial calculation example demonstrates recursion in action.
- The function calls itself with a smaller input until it reaches the base case.

### Advantages
- Concise code for certain problems.
- Can simplify complex algorithms.

### Disadvantages
- Can lead to stack overflow for large inputs.
- Requires understanding of base cases and termination conditions.
