# Exception Handling

Exception handling is a programming construct that deals with runtime errors or exceptional situations that may occur during program execution.

## Purpose
- To gracefully handle errors and prevent program crashes.
- Improve the robustness and reliability of the program.

## Example
- The `divide_numbers` function demonstrates exception handling with the try-except block.
- It catches the ZeroDivisionError when attempting to divide by zero.

### Key Concepts
- **try**: The block of code where exceptions can occur.
- **except**: Handles the exceptions raised in the try block.
- **else**: Executes if no exceptions are raised in the try block.
- **finally**: Executes cleanup code, regardless of whether an exception occurred.

### Importance
- Allows programs to recover from errors and continue execution.
- Enhances user experience by providing meaningful error messages.
- Essential for maintaining the integrity of data and resources.

### Best Practices
- Be specific in catching exceptions to handle only expected errors.
- Avoid catching generic exceptions like `Exception` as it may hide unexpected errors.
- Use multiple except blocks to handle different exceptions separately.
- Always include an `else` block if actions are to be taken when no exceptions occur.
- Use `finally` block for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.
