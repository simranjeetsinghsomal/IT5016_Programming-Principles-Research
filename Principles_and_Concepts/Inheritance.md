# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP, allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

## Example
- The Circle class inherits attributes and methods from the Shape class.

### Advantages
- Promotes code reuse.
- Allows for creating a hierarchy of classes.

### Disadvantages
- Can lead to deep class hierarchies that are hard to maintain.
- Tight coupling between classes can make code less flexible.
